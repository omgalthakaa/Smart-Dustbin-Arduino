# Smart-Dustbin-Arduino
Smart Dustbin Project using Arduino with Ultrasonic Sensor, Flame Sensor, MQ-135 Gas Sensor, and LEDs
Required Components:
Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
Flame Sensor
MQ-135 Gas Sensor
LEDs (Green, Yellow, Blue, Red, White)
Resistors
Jumper Wires
USB Cable to connect Arduino to the computer
Connections:

GND to GND on the Arduino
D0 to pin 5
A0 to pin A5
MQ-135 Gas Sensor:

VCC to 5V on the Arduino
GND to GND on the Arduino
AO to pin A0
LEDs:

Green LED: Anode to pin 13, Cathode to a resistor and then to GND
Yellow LED: Anode to pin 12, Cathode to a resistor and then to GND
Blue LED: Anode to pin 11, Cathode to a resistor and then to GND
Red LED: Anode to pin 10, Cathode to a resistor and then to GND
White LED: Anode to pin 9, Cathode to a resistor and then to GND
